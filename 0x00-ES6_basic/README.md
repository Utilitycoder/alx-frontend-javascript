# Basic ES6 Features

This repository is dedicated to showcasing my understanding and implementation of basic JavaScript ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) features. 

## Goal of the Repository
The goal of this repository is to share my learning journey and demonstrate my proficiency in using basic ES6 features in JavaScript. By showcasing the features I have learned, I hope to contribute to the knowledge of the wider community and inspire others to learn and adopt these modern JavaScript features.

## Features
The repository covers a range of basic ES6 features, including but not limited to:

- Arrow functions
- Template literals
- Destructuring assignment
- Let and const
- Classes
- Promises
- Modules
- Spread operator
- Rest parameters
- Default parameters
- etc.

Each feature is explained in detail, providing examples and demonstrations of its usage. By exploring the repository, users can gain a clear understanding of these features and how they can enhance their JavaScript coding skills.
