# ES6 Data Manipulation

The aim of this repository is to document my knowledge of using map, filter, and reduce on arrays in ES6, as well as working with typed arrays. Additionally, it covers the Set, Map, and WeakLink data structures. The code is just a minimum implementation of the aforementioned concepts.
